# pantherPressSlidesProject

I made a slideshow to introduce people to my school's newspaper club. The slideshow is aimed towards students at my school, but if other students want to use it as a general structure for their own school newspaper, that's fine.

Instructions:

1. Download the .pptx file in this repository.

2. Look through the slideshow
